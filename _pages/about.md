About
======
I am a quantitative social scientist interested in examining how socio-economic inequality shapes the lives of individuals.

Currently, I mainly study wealth inequality with a focus on the family, gender, and the superrich. In different projects I examine the role of the family in wealth perpetuation.

For my research I use various methods and data (survey data, experimental data, tax data, and web scraped data).
